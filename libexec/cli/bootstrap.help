USAGE: singularity [...] bootstrap <container path> <definition file>

The bootstrap command is useful for creating a new bootstrap or modifying an
existing one using a definition file that describes how to build the
container. The quickest, easiest Bootstrap is dumping DOcker layers into
a container:

    BootStrap: docker
    From: library/ubuntu:14.04.1

For more documentation on definition file recipes, look below.

note: This command must be executed as root.



CREATE OPTIONS:
    -T|--notest     Bootstrap without running tests in %test section
    -f|--force      Force a rebootstrap of an OS (note: this does not delete
                    what is currently in the image, just causes the core to
                    be reinstalled)
    -s|--section    Only run a given section within the bootstrap (setup,
                    post, files, environment, test, labels, none)
       --nobase     Skip the generation of the base OS


DEFFILE BASEOS EXAMPLES:

    Docker:
        BootStrap: docker
        From: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
        IncludeCmd: yes #Include the CMD/ENTRYPOINT as the Singularity Runscript

    YUM/RHEL:
        BootStrap: yum
        OSVersion: 7
        MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
        Include: yum #This is important to include inside the base container

    Debian/Ubuntu:
        BootStrap: debootstrap
        OSVersion: trusty
        MirrorURL: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/


DEFFILE SECTION EXAMPLES:

    %setup
        echo "This is a scriptlet that will be executed on the host, as root, after"
        echo "the container has been bootstrapped. To install things into the container"
        echo "reference the file system location with \$SINGULARITY_BUILDROOT"

    %post
        echo "This scriptlet section will be executed from within the container after"
        echo "the bootstrap/base has been created and setup"

    %test
        echo "Define any test commands that should be executed after container has been"
        echo "built. This scriptlet will be executed from within the running container"
        echo "as the root user. Pay attention to the exit/return value of this scriptlet"
        echo "as any non-zero exit code will be assumed as failure"
        exit 0

    %labels
        HELLO MOTO
        KEY VALUE

    %files
        /path/on/host/file.txt /path/on/container/file.txt 
        relative_file.txt /path/on/container/relative_file.txt


EXAMPLES:

    $ singularity create /tmp/Debian.img
    $ sudo singularity bootstrap /tmp/Debian.img debian.def
