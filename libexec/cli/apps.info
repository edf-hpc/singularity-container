List applications (apps) installed in a container, located at
    /scif/apps. See http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/

EXAMPLES:
    
    $ singularity apps ubuntu.img
     bar
     foo

To access apps, use shell, exec, run, inspect with --app <appname>

With all of the above, the following environment variables are available
to you when called from the shell inside the container. The top variables
are relevant to the active app (--app <app>) and the bottom available
for all apps regardless of the active:


ACTIVE APP ENVIRONMENT:

    SINGULARITY_APPNAME     the name of the application
    SINGULARITY_APPROOT     the application base (/scif/apps/<app>)
    SINGULARITY_APPMETA     the application metadata folder
    SINGULARITY_APPDATA     the data base folder for active app
        SINGULARITY_APPINPUT    expected input folder within data base folder
        SINGULARITY_APPOUTPUT   the output data folder within data base folder


GLOBAL APP ENVIRONMENT:
    
    SINGULARITY_DATA        scif defined data base for all apps (/scif/data)
    SINGULARITY_APPS        scif defined install bases for all apps (/scif/apps)
    APPROOT_<app>           root for application <app>
