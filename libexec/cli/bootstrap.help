USAGE: singularity [...] bootstrap <container path> <definition file>

The bootstrap command is useful for creating a new bootstrap or modifying an
existing one using a definition file that describes how to build the
container. A simple bootstrap definition file may be as simple as:

    BootStrap: debian
    OSVersion: stable
    MirrorURL: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

This simple bootstrap has within it all of the necessary bits of information
to bootstrap a minimal Ubuntu container image.

note: This command must be executed as root.

You can also bootstrap a Docker image, in which case you must also specify
the namespace (library), image repository (ubuntu) and tag (14.04.1) that
you want to use:

    BootStrap: docker
    From: library/ubuntu:14.04.1

The default Docker registry is registry-1.docker.io. To change that, add the
Registry argument:

    BootStrap: docker
    From: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
    Registry: gcr.io

If you want to remove token authentication, then add the Token argument:

    BootStrap: docker
    From: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
    Registry: gcr.io
    Token: no

CREATE OPTIONS:
    -f/--force      Force a rebootstrap of an OS (note: this does not delete
                    what is currently in the image, just causes the core to
                    be reinstalled)

EXAMPLES:

    $ sudo singularity create /tmp/Debian.img
    $ sudo singularity bootstrap /tmp/Debian.img debian.def

The debian.def in the above example refers to a bootstrap definition file as
demonstrated above.
